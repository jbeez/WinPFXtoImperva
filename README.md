Requirements:

1) Windows python installed, I used 3.8 for this.
2) API creds and ID in the apikey.py file.
3) Password for certificate.
4) Numerical siteid from the imperva portal for the domain you're trying to update the certificate on, either enter it when prompted or you can put the number by itself in a file, www.sitename.com.site_id in the sites folder.
5) Certificate file in pfx format, or pem and key format.
